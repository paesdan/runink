# Tools & Technologies Used in Runink

This page lists the major tools, libraries, and technologies that power the Runink platform. Understanding these will help you contribute, debug, or extend Runink more effectively.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Language

*Go (Golang)*

The foundation of Runink ‚Äî fast, statically typed, and great for concurrency.
Used for CLI, compilation, pipeline execution, and all orchestration.
Emphasizes simplicity, performance, and safe parallelism with goroutines and channels.

---

### üõ† CLI and Code Generation

*Cobra*

Library for building powerful CLI applications in Go.
Handles command definitions, flags, help messages, and auto-completion.
Templates are used for human-readable scaffolding.

---

### üîå Protocols and APIs

*gRPC*

Efficient binary protocol for remote execution of pipeline stages.
Enables distributed pipelines and microservice communication.

*Protobuf (Protocol Buffers)*

Used to define strongly typed data structures across services.
Great for defining contracts in a language-agnostic way.

---

### üìà Observability Stack

*Prometheus*

Collects and stores pipeline metrics (record counts, error rates, etc).
Easy integration with Grafana dashboards.

*Grafana*

Visualizes Prometheus metrics with dashboards and alerts.
Provides real-time insights into pipeline performance.

*OpenTelemetry*

Traces events and spans across pipeline stages.
Integrates with Jaeger or Grafana Tempo for distributed tracing.

*Zerolog / Zap*

Structured logging libraries for Go.
Logs include run_id, stage, contract_hash, and more.

---

### üß± Infrastructure & Build Tools

*Bigmachine*

Go library for building distributed, auto-scaling workers.
Supports running stateless compute tasks across many nodes.

*GoReleaser*

Automates versioned releases, cross-compilation, and SBOM generation.
Used to publish CLI binaries, plugins, and release metadata.

*Podman, Skopeo and Buildah*

Containerization of the CLI and distributed services.
Enables repeatable builds and deployments.

*Kubernetes*

Optional orchestration layer for scheduling pipelines at scale.

---

### üîí Security & Compliance

*SPDX License Scanning*

Ensures licensing metadata is maintained across dependencies.

*SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)*

Ensures visibility of dependencies and compliance with open-source best practices.

*gosec* 

Static analyzer that detects security vulnerabilities in Go code.

*OIDC / JWT* 

Used for identity-based authentication and access control (RBAC).
